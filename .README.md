# NestJS JWT authorization service

## Features
Service allows for CRUD operations on users, login, logout and regenerating access JWT tokens. 

All endpoints with descriptions are listed in the [queries.rest](queries.rest) file. If you are using VSC, you can install [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension to run these directly from the file. 

## Setup
Most convenient way to run the procjet is using docker:
```
docker compose up
```
